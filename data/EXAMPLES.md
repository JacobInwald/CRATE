## Examples Tested or To Test

    - [ ] [Polkit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50011): Not Stack Based Attack
    - [ ] [libbabl 0.1.62](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49259): While relevant to memory corruption, this is an engineered PoC of a library failing to fix memory corruptions errors, so is not relevant. 
    - [ ] [**Sudo 1.8.25p - 'pwfeedback' Buffer Overflow**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48052):
        - Seems to be a buffer overflow, sudo is C-based and open-source so code is available
        - Will investigate
    - [ ] [**Socat Buffer Overflow PoC](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47999): PoC, doesn't actually exploit anything, and no CVE.
