## Examples Tested or To Test

- ~~[X] [**Polkit**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50011):~~
    - Not Stack Based Attack
- ~~[X] [**libbabl 0.1.62**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49259):~
    - While relevant to memory corruption, this is an engineered PoC of a library failing to fix memory corruptions errors, so is not relevant. 
- [ ] [**Sudo 1.8.25p - 'pwfeedback' Buffer Overflow**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48052):
    - Seems to be a buffer overflow, sudo is C-based and open-source so code is available
    - Will investigate
- ~~[X] [**Socat Buffer Overflow PoC**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47999): ~~
    - PoC, doesn't actually exploit anything, and no CVE.
- [ ] [**ktsuss 1.4 - suid Privilege Escalation**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47344):
    - Not sure if overflow/Corruption error
    - Open-Source
    - C-based
- ~~[X] [**Exim 4.87 / 4.91 - Local Privilege Escalation (Metasploit)**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47307):~~
    - Open-Source
    - C-based
    - Don't think it is memory corruption related (edit: checked and yes no ROP or memory corruption)
- ~~[X] [**binutils 2.37 - Objdump Segmentation Fault**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50858): ~~
    - NIST reviewed and said not an exploit 
- [ ] [**Linux Kernel 2.6.19 < 5.9 - 'Netfilter Local Privilege Escalation**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50135):
    - Open-Source
    - C-based
    - Appears to be very powerful memory corruption attack
    - **Verified**
    - Will require work to somehow be able to rebuild only this dependency in Docker
- ~~[X] [**Apport Privilege Escalation**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49572):~~
    - Believe this is python based, and not sure if open-source
- ~~[X] [**Blueman**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48963):~~
    - Not memory corruption/Stack
- [ ] [**Gnome Fonts Viewer 3.34.0 - Heap Corruption**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48803):
    - Has potential, DoS attack I believe by corrupting Heap data, could be interesting to see if the hardening measures work
    - Open-Source, but would need some effort to get working on Docker. 
- [ ] [**OpenSMTPD - OOB Read Local Privilege Escalation (Metasploit)**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48185):
    - OOB Read so in correct category. 
    - Open Source
    - C-based
    - **Verified**
    - separate package and instructions on building from source!
- ~~[X] [**Diamorphine Rootkit - Signal Privilege Escalation (Metasploit)**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48131):~~
    - Rootkit, not correct category
- ~~[X] [**xglance-bin 11.00 - Privilege Escalation**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48000):~~
    - Old, and doesn't seem that relevant
- [ ] [**Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) - rds_atomic_free_op NULL pointer dereference Privilege Escalation (Metasploit)**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47957):
    - Abuses null pointer dereference, so in correct category, but may not be entirely relevant to heap
    - Impacts a kernel module so may be much more difficult to exploit
    - **Verified**
    - Open-Source + C-based
