% \chapter{Conclusions}

% \section{Final Reminder}

% The body of your dissertation, before the references and any appendices,
% \emph{must} finish by page~40. The introduction, after preliminary material,
% should have started on page~1.

% You may not change the dissertation format (e.g., reduce the font size, change
% the margins, or reduce the line spacing from the default single spacing). Be
% careful if you copy-paste packages into your document preamble from elsewhere.
% Some \LaTeX{} packages, such as \texttt{fullpage} or \texttt{savetrees}, change
% the margins of your document. Do not include them!

% Over-length or incorrectly-formatted dissertations will not be accepted and you
% would have to modify your dissertation and resubmit. You cannot assume we will
% check your submission before the final deadline and if it requires resubmission
% after the deadline to conform to the page and style requirements you will be
% subject to the usual late penalties based on your final submission time.

% % You may delete everything from \appendix up to \end{document} if you don't need it.
% \appendix

% \chapter{First appendix}

% \section{First section}

% Any appendices, including any required ethics information, should be included
% after the references.

% Markers do not have to consider appendices. Make sure that your contributions
% are made clear in the main body of the dissertation (within the page limit).

% \chapter{Participants' information sheet}

% If you had human participants, include key information that they were given in
% an appendix, and point to it from the ethics declaration.

% \chapter{Participants' consent form}

% If you had human participants, include information about how consent was
% gathered in an appendix, and point to it from the ethics declaration.
% This information is often a copy of a consent form.
