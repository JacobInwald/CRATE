## Exploit DB search
This folder stores the search strategy used. 
It is a bit cluttered, but each of the csvs are the different stages of filtering, with manual tagging occuring at each new csv file. 

### Scripts
- `search-exploit-db.py`: goes through the search process, printing which ones are dropped at which stage.
- `subset.py`: used to get the CWEs associated with each of the different exploits
